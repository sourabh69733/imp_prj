# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Structure 

Focus areas are Speed-- faster and better, performance and features which are really usefull, that one can easily navigate and use them. Buiding tracker and machine learning powered features, that are helpfull for students and instructor. Video player and also podcast player, lessons tab and quizes and assignments with some more usefull features like time bounding and video timestamp of that concept or form questions associated with that concept.

We write our own CSS and styles with help of team because we need performance and production quality and we need faster website which is only possible with our own css and styles. Also we do not want much most of time.

I want to build it great, that's all.
